    <h1>Digital electronics</h1>
    <P>Digital electronics is a branch of electronics that deals with systems and devices operating on digital signals, represented by binary numbers (0s and 1s). Unlike analog electronics, which use continuous signals, digital systems process discrete signals, making them highly accurate and less prone to noise. Digital electronics form the foundation of modern technology, powering devices such as computers, smartphones, and microcontrollers. Key components include logic gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, and memory units, which combine to perform complex operations and data storage. Digital circuits are built using integrated circuits (ICs) that house millions of transistors, enabling compact and efficient designs. These systems are widely used in communication, automation, and data processing. Digital electronics also allow for programmability and flexibility through concepts like Boolean algebra and sequential logic. As technology evolves, digital electronics continue to drive innovation, paving the way for advancements in artificial intelligence, IoT, and robotics.</P>
