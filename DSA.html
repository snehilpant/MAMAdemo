    <h1>Data Structures</h1>
    <P>Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science that organize and store data efficiently to facilitate operations like searching, sorting, and modification. They serve as the backbone of algorithms, enabling optimal problem-solving and effective resource management. Common types of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. Each is designed for specific use cases; for instance, stacks follow a Last In, First Out (LIFO) approach, while queues operate on First In, First Out (FIFO). Trees and graphs are ideal for hierarchical and network-based data representation, respectively. Proper selection of a data structure significantly impacts the performance of software applications, ensuring faster execution and reduced memory usage. Applications range from managing databases and network routing to implementing AI and machine learning models. Mastery of data structures is essential for programmers, as it forms the foundation for writing efficient code and designing robust systems.</P>
