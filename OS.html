    <h1>Operating system</h1>
    <P>An operating system (OS) is a fundamental software that manages computer hardware and software resources while providing essential services for applications to run. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, ensuring efficient and secure interaction. Key functions of an operating system include process management, memory management, file system organization, and device control. Popular operating systems like Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android cater to various devices, including personal computers, servers, and smartphones. The OS is responsible for multitasking, allowing multiple applications to run simultaneously by efficiently allocating system resources. It also ensures security by enforcing user authentication and protecting data from unauthorized access. Modern operating systems support graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for user-friendly interaction and include features like networking and virtual memory. As a core component of computing, operating systems enable the seamless execution of software and play a crucial role in technology-driven advancements.</P>
